# E-Handbook

E-Handbook is a short term for Student's Electronic Handbook, an Android App designed for students, teachers and stakeholders concerned for basic information about the school, Plaridel National High School.

The app is created back by me in June 2017 through the Ionic Creator Graphical User Interface at Plaridel National High School together with the help of the school administrators and the organization I was in during that time, the Supreme Student Government.

For now it was discontinued in lieu of better projects which information from this project may be included into it. There aren't any plans to continue this in the future, at least for now. The latest release has information that are already outdated. Perhaps, this may change anytime soon.
