# E-Handbook

E-Handbook is an abbreviated term for Student's Electronic Handbook that serves as an information hub for the students, parents, teachers, and stakeholders concerned about Plaridel National High School, its policies, clubs, and activities. The app is also made to minimize printing costs and also release additional features that are not possible on a handheld paper handbook.

The app was released back on June 23, 2017, through the Ionic Creator Graphical User Interface. It was created by Xyber Pastoril in collaboration with the school's Faculty and Staff and the Supreme Student Government.

The project was discontinued in lieu of bigger projects in which some parts of this information app will be integrated. The latest release was back in June 2018 and is now outdated. There are currently no plans on updating the app.
